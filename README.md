# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **Iris Dataset**. The Iris dataset is one of the most commonly used datasets in machine learning and statistics, consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers, categorized into three species: **Iris-setosa**, **Iris-versicolor**, and **Iris-virginica**. The goal of this project is to apply various EDA techniques to understand the dataset better, uncover insights, and visualize relationships among features.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to use **statistics and visualizations** to explore and understand the **Iris dataset**. We aim to:
1. **Generate Summary Statistics**: Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and other statistical measures for the dataset.
2. **Create Visualizations**: Use histograms, boxplots, and other charts to understand the distribution and spread of numeric features.
3. **Analyze Feature Relationships**: Explore how features relate to one another using pairplots and correlation matrices.
4. **Identify Patterns, Trends, and Anomalies**: Visualize trends and detect any anomalies in the data using scatter plots and boxplots.
5. **Draw Inferences from Visuals**: Make feature-level inferences based on the observations from the visualizations.

## Dataset Overview
The Iris dataset contains the following columns:
- **Id**: Unique identifier for each observation.
- **SepalLengthCm**: Length of the sepal in centimeters.
- **SepalWidthCm**: Width of the sepal in centimeters.
- **PetalLengthCm**: Length of the petal in centimeters.
- **PetalWidthCm**: Width of the petal in centimeters.
- **Species**: The species of the Iris flower (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica).

The dataset is widely used in classification tasks and is a great example for practicing EDA.

## Tools and Libraries
The following tools and libraries were used in this project:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and basic analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical plots such as boxplots, pairplots, and heatmaps.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.
  
Install the necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
